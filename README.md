# Data-Science-Projects
Portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic and self learning purpose


Contents

Project-1:

Zomato Exploratory Analysis (Technology Used - Python, OracleDB)

Project description:

•Utilized their data to understand about the top restaurants, factors which make them the best and also performed a sentimental analysis on their popularity on Twitter

•Maximized the dataset efficiency provided by Zomato using several data cleaning and exploratory techniques such as imputation, null value removal, removing duplicates.

•Applied machine learning algorithms- Linear Regression, Naive Bayes to identify key metrics in accurately predicting the ratings of restaurants and presented the findings in the form of interactive visualizations.


Project-2:

Income Prediction - US Census Income Dataset (Technology Used - Apache Spark, Python)

Project description:

•Predicted the income of the US citizens by creating Logistic Regression and Random Forest models using Python

•Analyzed, integrated and prepared the census income data by imputation, binning and discretization of independent variables , performed data exploration using the Matplotlib Library in Jupyter Notebook

•Performed feature engineering, exploratory analysis & dimensionality reduction to finalize a list of features for ML modelling


Project-3:

Owned/Leased Houses and Parking Spaces in USA (Technology Used – Tableau and MS Excel)

Project description:

•Utilized the government data to visualize data with many different filters and parameters using Tableau.

•Supervised the data to troubleshoot missing values and address required fields


Project-4:

Online Customer Intention Prediction (Technology Used – AzureML, Tableau, MS Excel)

Project description:

•Analyzed customer behavior patterns to predict an intention to buy from a website with the help of Neural Networks, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression using AzureML

•Created an interactive dashboard in Tableau to understand the relationship of different factors affecting customer behavior


Project-5:

Telecom Customer Churn (Technology Used – SAS Enterprise Miner, Tableau and MS Excel)

Project description:

•Identified and predicted all possible reasons and cases of customer churning using a dataset of a private telecom company

•Analyzed all relevant customer data to develop focused customer retention programs using Predictive Analysis Modeling while creating Neural Networks and Decision Trees in SAS Enterprise Miner

•Compared the multiple models for better prediction using varied evaluation metrics, created an interactive dashboard for the same using Tableau for better decision making


Project-6:

Bank Customer Term Deposit (Technology Used – Pyspark, SQL, Python, Tableau)

Project description:

•Performed pre-processing using Scalar and String Indexer on a 1.4GB banking dataset based on marketing campaign phone calls to know whether a customer will subscribe for the term deposit or not

•Built predictive models namely Linear SVC, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree using Pyspark on Databricks platform over a 80% train and 20% test dataset to obtain a 79% accuracy given by the Decision Tree model
